Status key: âœ… completed  â€¢  ðŸ”¶ in-progress  â€¢  â¬œ not-started

1. âœ… Ask clarifying questions
   - Gather details about scope, priorities, integrations, naming rules, templates, acceptance criteria, file naming/sequence, and any constraints (map provider, geocoder).

2. âœ… Review PRD
   - Review `/tasks/0001-prd-plottr.md` and propose defaults where missing.

3. âœ… Confirm backend stack
   - Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Objection/Knex; OpenAPI 3; JWT; S3; Mapbox geocoding.

4. âœ… Generate parent tasks from PRD
   - Create high-level parent tasks and pause for confirmation.

5. âœ… Generate sub-tasks from PRD
   - Expand parents into detailed sub-tasks and list files to create.

6. âœ… Generate initial DB migration + seed
   - Create Postgres+PostGIS Knex migrations and a templates seed; add a Jest migration verification test.

7. âœ… Install Docker Desktop & start Postgres+PostGIS
   - Local dev instructions and the `plottr-pg` container setup were validated.

8. ðŸ”¶ Scaffold OpenAPI + server stubs
   - OpenAPI spec exists and has been extended; server stub generation is in-progress.

9. â¬œ Create RN prototype

18. â¬œ Backup & Disaster Recovery
    - DB backup strategy and S3 lifecycle policies (not started).

19. âœ… Integration test for templates endpoint
    - Supertest integration test added; runs migrations+seeds and validates GET /api/templates.

20. âœ… Wired OPENAI_MODEL config and helper
    - `OPENAI_MODEL` added to config and `.env.example`; `src/lib/openai.ts` present.

21. âœ… Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI
    - `openapi/plottr.yaml` â†’ `src/types/openapi.ts` generated and committed.

22. âœ… Add npm scripts: gen:types + check:types
    - `gen:types` and `check:types` added to `package.json`.

23. âœ… Type templates service & controller with OpenAPI types
    - Templates service/controller use generated OpenAPI types and Zod validation.

24. ðŸ”¶ Replicate types + Zod for venues/pitches/sessions
    - Files for `venues`, `pitches`, `sessions` were created; pattern replication is in-progress.

25. âœ… Commit staged changes
    - `package.json` and `.husky/pre-commit` updates committed.

26. âœ… Commit endpoint files
    - Newly created endpoints committed.

27. âœ… Add OpenAPI schemas for venues/pitches/sessions
    - `Venue`, `Pitch`, `Session` schemas added to OpenAPI and types regenerated.

28. â¬œ Create seeds for venues/pitches/sessions
    - Seeds required for integration tests (not started).

29. ðŸ”¶ Fix test DB connectivity & credentials
    - Investigation in progress: intermittent SASL / "unable to acquire connection" errors; deferred fixes applied (lazy knex init) and further triage pending.

30. â¬œ Improve tests
    - Replace placeholder unit tests with real tests and add integration tests for new endpoints (not started).

31. ðŸ”¶ Link Mapbox account
    - `MAPBOX_TOKEN` added to `.env.example` and `src/config`; server-side Mapbox wrapper, route, and controller created and in-progress verification.

---

Notes & next actions (short):
- Re-run integration tests now that DB initialization has been made lazy (`src/data/*repo.ts` constructors). If failures persist, add masked logging inside `src/data/knex.ts` and ensure `DATABASE_URL_TEST` is set before imports in tests.
- Add seeds for venues/pitches/sessions (task 28) once templates integration is green.
- If you want task 31 marked fully completed, confirm that Mapbox verification (calling `/api/geocode`) returned 200 and body data â€” I can then mark it âœ… and commit the tasks file.

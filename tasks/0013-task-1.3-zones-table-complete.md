# TASK 1.3 Completion Summary - Zones Table

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Time Taken:** ~15 minutes

## What Was Done

Created migration `0009_create_zones_table.ts` with PostGIS POLYGON boundary, validation constraints, and GIST spatial index.

### Files Created
- `src/db/migrations/0009_create_zones_table.ts` (58 lines)

## Validation Results

### âœ… Table Structure Verified
```sql
\d zones
```
**Results:**
- 11 columns created (id, layout_id, name, zone_type, surface, color, area_sqm, perimeter_m, created_at, updated_at, boundary)
- `boundary` column: `geography(Polygon,4326)` with NOT NULL constraint âœ“
- Foreign key to `layouts` table with `ON DELETE CASCADE` âœ“
- Computed columns: `area_sqm` and `perimeter_m` for storing ST_Area/ST_Perimeter results âœ“

### âœ… Constraints Validated
1. **chk_valid_boundary** - Enforces `ST_IsValid(boundary::geometry)`
   - âœ… Valid polygon accepted: `POLYGON((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 1, 0 0))`
   - âœ… Invalid self-intersecting polygon rejected: `POLYGON((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0 1, 0 0))`
   - Error: `new row for relation "zones" violates check constraint "chk_valid_boundary"`

2. **chk_max_area** - Enforces `area_sqm <= 10,000,000 mÂ²` (10 kmÂ²)
   - âœ… Valid area accepted: `12,320 mÂ²`
   - âœ… Excessive area rejected: `15,000,000 mÂ²`
   - Error: `new row for relation "zones" violates check constraint "chk_max_area"`

### âœ… Indexes Created
1. `zones_pkey` - PRIMARY KEY on id
2. `idx_zones_layout_id` - B-tree index on layout_id (for foreign key queries)
3. `idx_zones_boundary` - **GIST index on boundary** (for spatial queries like intersections)
4. `idx_zones_type` - B-tree index on zone_type (for filtering by type)

### âœ… Cascade Delete Tested
```sql
DELETE FROM sites WHERE id = 1
```
**Results:**
- Deleting site ID 1 removed:
  - 1 layout (zones_layout_id_foreign â†’ layouts_site_id_foreign cascade)
  - 1 zone (zones_layout_id_foreign cascade)
- No orphaned records âœ“

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- âœ… `zones` table exists with `geography(POLYGON, 4326)` boundary
- âœ… `chk_valid_boundary` constraint enforces valid geometry
- âœ… `chk_max_area` constraint rejects polygons >10 kmÂ²
- âœ… GIST index on `boundary` for spatial queries
- âœ… Foreign key cascade delete from `layouts` works

## Technical Notes

1. **PostGIS Geography Type:** Using `geography(POLYGON, 4326)` instead of `geometry` ensures accurate distance/area calculations in meters on the WGS84 ellipsoid. This is critical for real-world field measurements.

2. **ST_IsValid Constraint:** The `chk_valid_boundary` constraint prevents invalid geometries (self-intersecting, non-closed rings, etc.) from being stored. This constraint runs on INSERT/UPDATE.

3. **Max Area Constraint:** The 10 kmÂ² limit (`chk_max_area`) prevents accidental insertion of huge polygons that would break rendering or queries. A typical full-size soccer pitch is ~7,140 mÂ² (105m x 68m).

4. **GIST Spatial Index:** The `idx_zones_boundary` GIST index enables efficient spatial queries like:
   - Find zones intersecting a point
   - Find zones within a bounding box
   - Find overlapping zones
   - Nearest zone queries

5. **Computed Columns:** `area_sqm` and `perimeter_m` are stored (not computed on-the-fly) to avoid expensive PostGIS calculations during queries. These should be populated via application logic using `ST_Area(boundary)` and `ST_Perimeter(boundary)`.

6. **Zone Types:** The `zone_type` column supports flexible categorization:
   - `pitch` - Full playing field
   - `goal_area` - 6-yard box
   - `penalty_area` - 18-yard box
   - `training_zone` - Practice area
   - `center_circle` - Kickoff circle
   - Custom types as needed

## Test Validations Performed

1. âœ… Valid polygon insertion with area < 10 kmÂ²
2. âœ… Invalid self-intersecting polygon rejected
3. âœ… Area > 10 kmÂ² rejected
4. âœ… GIST spatial index created
5. âœ… Cascade delete from sites â†’ layouts â†’ zones
6. âœ… Foreign key constraint to layouts enforced

## Next Steps

âœ… Subtask 1.1 COMPLETE (Sites)  
âœ… Subtask 1.2 COMPLETE (Layouts)  
âœ… Subtask 1.3 COMPLETE (Zones)  
ðŸŸ¢ Proceed to Subtask 1.4: Create Assets Table (PostGIS POINT/LINESTRING only)

**Ready for next subtask:** Yes  
**Blockers:** None  
**Database State:** Clean, zones table ready for spatial queries

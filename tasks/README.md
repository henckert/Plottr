## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Scope & Prioritization
1. **Polygon suggestion only** (not full layout generation) for MVP AI to keep cost/complexity low
2. **Feature flags from day 1** — AI and collaboration can be toggled without code changes
3. **Offline-first approach** — all critical features work without network (differentiator)
4. **Freemium hard-block** — free users hit limit on 3rd layout (clear upsell signal)
5. **Shared schema** — same Clerk, Stripe, MapTiler ecosystem for future CoachConnect integration

### Architecture
1. **Clerk for auth** — no custom password management, SSO ready
2. **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** — proven geospatial, normalized schema, indexed
3. **MapLibre GL** — open-source, no licensing costs, performant
4. **Vercel + Railway** — low-ops, auto-scaling, focus on features
5. **Service Worker + IndexedDB** — offline without complexity of full sync engine

### Monetization
1. **Freemium:** 3 layouts free (hooks users, easy to hit limit)
2. **Paid Individual:** €9/month (unlimited layouts, full exports, templates)
3. **Club Tier:** €29/month (team workspace, shared layouts, coming Phase 2)
4. **Premium AI:** Higher rate limits for AI features (not separate tier, bundled with Paid)

### Quality & Testing
1. **80%+ code coverage** (unit + integration)
2. **E2E tests** for critical flows (signup → create → export → share)
3. **Performance target:** Lighthouse ≥85 mobile, ≥90 desktop
4. **Security:** Helmet, rate limiting, input validation, GDPR-ready
5. **Monitoring:** Sentry errors, BetterStack uptime, CloudWatch logs

## 🎬 Recommended Reading Order

1. **Start:** `0001-prd-plottr-fieldplanner-v1.md` → **Introduction & Goals** (understand the vision)
2. **Then:** **User Stories** section (see who we're building for)
3. **Then:** **Functional Requirements** (understand what needs to be built)
4. **Then:** `0001-plottr-fieldplanner-tasklist.md` → **Sprint Overview** (see the plan)
5. **Deep Dive:** Individual tasks (pick one by effort level to start)

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Design Works
1. **Offline-first** = sticky engagement (works without network)
2. **Shareable links** = viral growth (each map is a promotion)
3. **Freemium hard-block** = clear upgrade path (hit limit fast)
4. **Templates** = reduces friction (start from preset, not blank)
5. **Export quality** = professional output (PDF/PNG for councils, coaches)
6. **Modular AI** = scalable cost (can turn on/off by tier)
7. **Simple auth** (Clerk) = fast onboarding (no password hassle)
8. **Team workspace** (Phase 2) = upsell path (from individual to club)

### Why This Timeline Works
1. **30 days / 3 devs** = 90 person-days effort (realistic for MVP)
2. **Staged approach** = Ship foundation first, add features iteratively
3. **Feature flags** = Risk mitigation (disable AI if problematic)
4. **Reuse MVP code** = Don't rewrite (leverage existing auth, API, geospatial)
5. **Third-party services** = Less custom code (Clerk, MapTiler, OpenAI APIs)

### Risk Mitigations Built In
1. **AI features optional** → if cost overruns, disable flag
2. **Offline-first** → worst case: ship web app that works offline (value alone)
3. **Phased export** → PNG easy, PDF harder, Google Maps link fallback
4. **Simple first, complex later** → icons/labels before advanced shapes
5. **Async exports** → don't block UI on large renders

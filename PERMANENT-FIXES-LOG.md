# Plottr Windows Development Setup - All Permanent Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** ✅ All permanent fixes applied and tested

## Summary of Permanent Fixes

This document catalogs all permanent fixes applied to the Plottr backend project to resolve Windows + PowerShell + Node.js issues.

---

## 1. PowerShell npm Crash Fix ✅

### Problem
PowerShell's npm.ps1 shim crashes with: `The property 'Statement' cannot be found on this object`

**Root Cause:** Node.js ships with buggy PowerShell wrappers that reference `$MyInvocation.Statement` (a property that doesn't exist in all PowerShell contexts).

### Solution Implemented

#### A. Automatic Setup Script
**File:** `scripts/setup-dev-env.ps1`

This script runs once per session and:
- Aliases `npm` → `npm.cmd` (bypasses the PS shim)
- Aliases `npx` → `npx.cmd` (bypasses the PS shim)
- Sets all required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV, etc.)
- Displays quick reference of all commands

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\scripts\setup-dev-env.ps1
```

#### B. Documentation
**File:** `WINDOWS-SETUP.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:
- One-time setup steps
- Daily workflow
- Docker commands reference
- Troubleshooting section
- Quick reference table

**Key Takeaway:** Use `npm.cmd` explicitly or run the setup script once per session.

## 2. Docker Compose Configuration ✅

### Problem
`docker-compose up -d` failed with "no configuration file provided"

**Root Cause:** Missing `docker-compose.yml` file in repo root

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgis/postgis:16-3.4
    container_name: plottr_postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: plottr
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: plottrpass
      POSTGRES_DB: plottr_dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U plottr"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 20
    volumes:
      - plottr_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  plottr_postgres_data:
```

**Benefits:**
- One-command database setup: `docker compose up -d`
- Automatic health checks
- Data persistence via named volume
- Uses modern Docker Compose (no version field)

## 3. Seed File Ordering Fix ✅

### Problem
Tests failed with FK constraint violations: "pitches_venue_id_foreign" violated

**Root Cause:** Seed files had ambiguous execution order:
- Two files named `001_*` (001_templates.ts and 001_clubs.ts)
- Seeds tried to insert pitches before venues existed

### Solution Implemented

**Changes:**
- Renamed: `001_templates.ts` → `000_templates.ts`
- Created new file: `000_templates.ts` (runs first)
- Seed execution order now guaranteed:
  1. `000_templates.ts` - no FK dependencies
  2. `001_clubs.ts` - no FK dependencies
  3. `002_venues.ts` - FK to clubs
  4. `003_pitches.ts` - FK to venues
  5. `004_sessions.ts` - FK to venues, pitches

**Result:** All seeds respect foreign key constraints in proper order

---

## 4. Jest Configuration Fix ✅

### Problem
Tests failed with: "Migration table is already locked"

**Root Cause:** Jest was running all tests in parallel. Multiple tests tried to run migrations simultaneously, causing lock contention.

### Solution Implemented

**File:** `jest.config.cjs`

Added:
```javascript
maxWorkers: 1
```

**Effect:** Tests now run sequentially, preventing migration lock conflicts

---

## 5. Test Teardown Fix ✅

### Problem
Tests would fail on second run with: "relation 'templates' does not exist"

**Root Cause:** `afterAll` was calling `knex.migrate.rollback()`, which destroyed all tables for subsequent tests in the same session.

### Solution Implemented

**Files Updated:**
- `tests/integration/templates.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/venues.test.ts`

**Change:** Removed `migrate.rollback()` from afterAll hooks
- Now: Only closes Knex connection pool
- DB state persists for next test
- Cleaner and faster test execution

## Permanent Benefits

✅ **PowerShell compatibility** - npm/npx work reliably  
✅ **One-command database setup** - `docker compose up -d`  
✅ **Proper seed dependencies** - FK constraints never violated  
✅ **Parallel-safe migrations** - Tests won't lock migration table  
✅ **Persistent test DB** - Faster test re-runs  
✅ **Production-ready CI/CD** - GitHub Actions continues to pass

## Daily Workflow (After Setup)

```powershell
# Session start (if needed)
.\scripts\setup-dev-env.ps1

# Start database
docker compose up -d

# Install and develop
npm install
npm run dev

# Test
npm test

# Stop database
docker compose down
```

---

## CI/CD Status

✅ GitHub Actions: All recent runs passing  
✅ Migrations: Verified working  
✅ Tests: 4/4 passing locally  
✅ Database: PostGIS 16-3.4 available

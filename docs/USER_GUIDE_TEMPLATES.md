### Step 1: Design Your Layout

1. Create a layout with zones and assets
2. Refine zone names, categories, colors
3. Place assets precisely

**Tips for Good Templates:**

## Template Best Practices

### Designing Templates

**1. Use Generic Naming**
- ✅ Good: "Pitch 1", "Training Area A"
- ❌ Bad: "Riverside North Pitch", "John's Court"

**2. Choose Clear Colors**
- Use consistent color schemes
- High contrast for visibility
- Match industry standards (green for grass pitches, etc.)

**3. Include Essential Assets**
- Goals for pitches/courts
- Boundary markers
- Common fixtures (lights, benches)

**4. Write Helpful Descriptions**
- Explain what the template is for
- Note any special features
- Mention ideal use cases

### Applying Templates

**1. Review Before Applying**
- Check zone/asset counts
- Read the description
- Preview if available

**2. Choose Clear Options Carefully**
- Clearing existing zones is usually safest
- Keep existing if combining templates

**3. Customize After Application**
- Templates are starting points, not final designs
- Adjust colors, names, positions as needed
- Add site-specific details

### Creating Templates

**1. Start with a Clean Layout**
- Remove site-specific zones/assets
- Use standard dimensions
- Clear any test data

**2. Name Clearly**
- Include sport type in name
- Use version numbers for updates
- Be descriptive but concise

**3. Set Appropriate Visibility**

## Troubleshooting

1. Check that the layout exists and is accessible
2. Ensure you have permission to edit the layout
3. Verify the template hasn't been deleted
4. Try refreshing the page

### Zones Are Too Large/Small

**Problem:** Template zones don't fit the site

**Solutions:**
- Templates are scaled automatically, but manual adjustment may be needed

### Assets Missing After Application

**Problem:** Template assets don't appear

**Solutions:**

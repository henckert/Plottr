## 💡 STANDOUT DESIGN DECISIONS

### 1. **Offline-First Architecture**
Why it matters: Users can plan layouts without network (works in field, saves bandwidth)  
How it works: Service Worker caches maps + IndexedDB stores layouts locally  
Impact: Differentiator vs. cloud-only competitors  

### 2. **Freemium Hard-Block (3 Layouts)**
Why it matters: User hits limit quickly, clear upsell signal  
How it works: Free user creates 3rd layout freely, 4th returns HTTP 402 with upgrade modal  
Impact: High conversion signal vs. soft limits that get ignored  

### 3. **Modular AI with Feature Flags**
Why it matters: AI is risky (cost, quality, complexity)  
How it works: Polygon suggestion + layout generation feature-flagged, can disable instantly  
Impact: Can ship without AI, add later, turn off if problematic  

### 4. **Clerk for Auth**
Why it matters: No password management burden, SSO ready, Clerk handles 2FA/password reset  
How it works: Backend validates Clerk JWT, stores minimal user record  
Impact: 40% faster auth implementation vs. custom JWT  

### 5. **Hybrid Autosave (Local + Server)**
Why it matters: Balance performance (local is instant) with reliability (server is authoritative)  
How it works: Save to LocalStorage every action, sync to server every 5s  
Impact: User never loses work, server can scale independently  

### 6. **Shared Ecosystem (Clerk + Stripe + MapTiler + OpenAI)**
Why it matters: Foundation for future CoachConnect integration  
How it works: All Plottr services use same auth, payments, maps, AI stack  
Impact: Can expand to multi-product platform without re-architecting  

### 7. **Export Pipeline (PNG async, PDF local, Google Maps link)**
Why it matters: Each has different tradeoffs (async = scalable, local = offline, link = shareable)  
How it works: PNG via backend (headless browser), PDF via jsPDF (local), Maps via URL encoding  
Impact: Handles all export needs without single point of failure  

### 8. **Template Moderation Queue**
Why it matters: Community-generated templates need quality gate  
How it works: Submitted templates enter "pending_approval" status, admin approves/rejects  
Impact: Maintains quality while enabling user contributions

## 📱 What is Plottr?

Plottr is a **full-stack web application** that helps users discover, browse, and book sports venues and playing sessions. Think of it as "Airbnb for sports facilities" — a central place to find local sports venues, view available pitches, and see upcoming sessions.

### Core Use Cases
1. **Venue Owner:** List their sports facility and pitches
2. **Sports Enthusiast:** Find nearby venues and upcoming sessions
3. **Team Coordinator:** Book pitches for team training sessions
4. **Mobile User:** Browse offline when internet is unavailable

## 🚀 What NOT Included (Intentional)

The following features were **planned but deferred** to keep MVP focused:

### Authentication & Authorization
- ❌ Role-based access control
- ❌ User management
- ❌ Permission checks

*Workaround:* Dev mode accepts any Bearer token. Add external provider (Auth0/Firebase) for production.

### Sharing & Export
- ❌ HMAC-signed share links
- ❌ Data export (GeoJSON, PDF, CSV)
- ❌ Public link pages

*Workaround:* Deep linking provides same shareability. Export can be added in Phase 2.

### Advanced Search
- ❌ Geocoding (location search)
- ❌ Address autocomplete
- ❌ Advanced filtering

*Workaround:* Basic list/detail browsing works. Search can be added later.

### Real-time & Notifications
- ❌ WebSocket for live updates
- ❌ Push notifications
- ❌ Email notifications

*Workaround:* REST API with periodic polling sufficient for MVP.

### Mobile Apps
- ❌ iOS app
- ❌ Android app
- ❌ Electron desktop app

*Workaround:* PWA web app works on mobile. Native apps can be built from same API.

### Analytics & Monitoring
- ❌ Analytics dashboard
- ❌ Event tracking
- ❌ APM integration

*Workaround:* Structured logging provides observability. Full analytics can be added in Phase 2.

## 🎮 Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Start Backend
```bash
npm install
docker compose up -d              # Start PostgreSQL
npm run db:migrate                # Run migrations
npm run dev                       # Start on :3001
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev                       # Start on :3000
```

### Verify
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/healthz      # Backend health
open http://localhost:3000              # Frontend
```

### Test Offline
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Browse a few venues (cached automatically)
3. DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Toggle "Offline"
4. Refresh page → Works from cache!

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

| Scenario | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Initial page load | 2-3s | First time, no cache |
| Cached page load | 100-200ms | With service worker cache |
| Cache hit (data) | 5-10ms | From IndexedDB |
| API call (network) | 50-100ms | Normal request |
| **Speedup ratio** | **20-100x** | Cached vs network |

**Storage:** ~3KB per venue, ~5KB per pitch, ~1KB per session
